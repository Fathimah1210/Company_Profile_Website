### Hi there! Thank you for visiting my repository.



This website was created to meet the needs of retail stores selling heavy equipment. It consists of two parts: an admin dashboard and a company profile. The two are connected, especially through the "Our Products" menu, which displays an online product catalogue ready for purchase through the store's employees.



If you have any questions about the website, I'd be happy to answer them.

Additional information:

1. Using the Laravel framework to create an admin dashboard and company profile website.
2. Using an API to predict shipping costs.
3. The design used on the company profile website is Tailwind CSS and HTML.
4. Product and other data on the company profile website are retrieved from a MySQL database.



Thank you!
